# LITTLEPROGRAM

## Purpose of the project

This web app is using the library React.js for the front. Node.js is used for the back, and mongoDB is the server.

The purpose of the application is to make a sort of a clone of an OS interface. I will implement different kind of features like a voice recognition, a game, a chat, a command line interface for a very first version. 

My will through this application is to show that I'm a really curious person, and that i'm able to be self-taught.
